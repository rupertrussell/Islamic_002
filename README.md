I have posed a question on Quora.com hopefully someone can offer some guidance https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Trying-to-work-out-the-x-y-coordinates-of-a-projected-line-when-it-intersects-with-another-line# 

I also have a webpage with details of my progress at: http://www.rupert.id.au/processing/examples/projection/index.html

January 26 2023 I have just purchased and assessmebled an AxiDraw MiniKit2 Plotter which is amazing.
Have updated version 38_1 of this program to allow me to isolate the design lines from the guidelines 
this will enable me to create a SVG file with 2 layers one for the guidelines and another for the design.
This way I can plot the guideliens with one pen (I plan to use a 0.25mm Rotring Isograph pen) 
and then the Design Lines with another pen (I will use a 0.7mm Rotring Isograph pen)
